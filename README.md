Cypress with Cucumber v9 (or below) Automation Repository

This repository contains a test automation framework built with Cypress and Cucumber, using version 9 or below of the Cypress-Cucumber-Preprocessor. It enables Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) for writing automated tests in a human-readable format.

Key Features:

- Integrates Cypress with Cucumber to write tests in Gherkin syntax
- Follows the Page Object Model (POM) design pattern for better test maintenance
- Provides a structured folder hierarchy for features, step definitions, pages, and support files
- Includes utilities and custom commands for efficient test execution
- Uses environment variables for secure storage of sensitive information

This framework facilitates the creation of reliable and maintainable automated tests for web applications. It encourages collaboration between technical and non-technical team members by enabling the creation of executable specifications.

Feel free to clone and adapt this repository to suit your specific testing needs. Contributions and improvements are welcome!
